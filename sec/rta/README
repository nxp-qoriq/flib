Runtime Assembler provides an easy and flexible runtime method for writing
SEC descriptors.

1. What's supported
===================
1.1 Initialization/verification code for descriptor buffer.
1.2 Configuration/verification code for SEC commands:
       FIFOLOAD and SEQFIFOLOAD;
       FIFOSTORE and SEQFIFOSTORE;
       SHARED HEADER and JOB HEADER;
       JUMP;
       KEY;
       LOAD and SEQLOAD;
       MATH;
       MOVE and MOVELEN;
       NFIFO - pseudo command (shortcut for writing FIFO entries using LOAD command);
       PKA OPERATION and ALGORITHM OPERATION;
       PROTOCOL;
       SEQ IN PTR and SEQ OUT PTR;
       SIGNATURE;
       STORE and SEQSTORE.
1.3 Support for referential code:
        patching routines for LOAD, MOVE, JUMP and HEADER commands.
1.4 Support for 32bits/36bits pointer size.

2. What's not supported
=======================
2.1 Era verification for SEC commands.

3. Integration
==============
To integrate this tool into your project, rta.h file must be included.

4. Run
======
The examples are located in 'tests' directory:
   tests/
        kasumi_dcrc_decap_opt.c
        test_nfifo.c
        test_operation_alg.c
        make_rsa_keys_1.c
        ...

The provided Makefile contains the necessary include paths and compiler flags
to build all examples.

$ cd tests
$ make all
 or
$ make <test_name>

In order to run all examples, use
$ make check

This will automatically build the tests and run all of them sequentially,
saving the output in corresponding *.desc files.
